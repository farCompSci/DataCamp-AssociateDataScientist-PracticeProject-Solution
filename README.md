As I prepared for the Data Camp Associate Data Scientist Certification, I worked on their practice project. Here, I attached my solution notebook, as well as the associated files. 

## Data Camp Associate Data Scientist
This certification is marketed as Industry Recognized, and the Projects are pretty helpful in learning Data Science and Machine Learning. Completing most projects helped me understand multiple 
important concepts from data wrangling, preprocessing, all the way to boosted Tree models. I strongly recommend for a foundation in Data Science.
